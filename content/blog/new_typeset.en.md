# A new typesetter
I am currently using Typst instead of LaTeX.

If you want to get the Typst code to e.g. copy the exercise description into your own document then you can use Mathpix to get the LaTeX code. Use Pandoc to translate the LaTeX code to Typst with

```powershell
> Get-Clipboard | pandoc -f latex -t typst
```

I have double the amount of free scans because of my university email.
